Summary	
Start with a paragraph summarizing the purpose or goal of your project, the technologies used, and the results.
  The purpose of our project is to create an app that will display the weather for any location that is input. The user would first input the location 
  in which they want to know the weather for, and then the application will grab that information from a weather website and display it. Our project does just that 
  so we would say that it is successful at what it does. 

Code images
Include images (Links to an external site.) of the important parts of your code.

Code descriptions
Explain the code in each image.

More ideas
What would you do next if you had to (or chose to) do a follow-up project?
  We would make a search box that the user can input the location into instead of having them input it into the terminal. We would 
  also make it so that the application would display the forcast over the next couple of days instead of just displaying 1 day.
